By default, future-based code runs sequentially, but with a _single
line of code_, we easily switch to run the exact same code in
parallel. The most common approach is to parallelize on the local
machine, but we have also the option to harness the CPUs of other
local or remote machines.  For example, to parallelize on the local
machine, the end-user can call:

```r
plan(multisession)
```

After this, all of Futureverse, including **[future.apply]**,
**[furrr]**, and **[doFuture]**, and any package that use these, will
run the code in parallel.

To switch back to sequential processing, we can call:

```r
plan(sequential)
```

If you have Secure Shell (SSH) access to other machines on your local
network, or remote machines, call:

```r
plan(cluster, workers = c("n1", "n1", "n2", "remote.server.org"))
```

This will set up four parallel workers, where two run on the local
'n1' machine, another on the local 'n2' machine, and the fourth on the
remote 'remote.server.org' machine.


The **[future]** package comes with built-in future backends that leverage the **parallel** package part of R itself. In addition to these backends, others exist in package extensions, e.g. **[future.callr]**, **[future.mirai]**, and **[future.batchtools]**. Below is an overview of the most common backends that you as an end-user can chose from.

| Package / Backend             | Features    | How futures are evaluated
|:----------------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------
| **[future]**<br> `sequential`    | üì∂<br>‚ôªÔ∏è<br>         | sequentially and in the current R process; default 
| **[future]**<br> `multisession`  | üì∂<br>‚ôªÔ∏è<br>        | parallelly via background R sessions on current machine
| **[future]**<br> `cluster`       | üì∂<br>‚ôªÔ∏è*<br>       | parallelly in external R sessions on current, local, and/or remote machines
| **[future]**<br> `multicore`     | üì∂<br>‚ôªÔ∏è<br> | (not recommended) parallelly via forked R processes on current machine; not with GUIs like RStudio; not on Windows
| **[future.callr]**<br> `callr`                    | üì∂(next)<br>‚ôªÔ∏è(next)<br> | parallelly via transient **[callr]** background R sessions on current machine; all memory is returned when as each future is resolved
| **[future.mirai]**<br> `mirai_multisession`       | üì∂(next)<br>‚ôªÔ∏è(next)<br> | parallelly via **[mirai]** background R sessions on current machine; low latency
| **[future.mirai]**<br> `mirai_cluster`            |‚ôªÔ∏è(next)<br> | parallelly via **[mirai]** daemons running locally or remotely
| **[future.batchtools]**<br> `batchtools_lsf`<br>`batchtools_openlava`<br>`batchtools_sge`<br>`batchtools_slurm`<br>`batchtools_torque` | üì∂(soon)<br> ‚ôªÔ∏è(soon) | parallelly on HPC job schedulers (Load Sharing Facility [LSF], OpenLava, TORQUE/PBS, Son/Sun/Oracle/Univa Grid Engine [SGE], Slurm) via **[batchtools]**; for long-running tasks; high latency |

üì∂: futures relay progress updates in real-time<br>
‚ôªÔ∏è: futures are interruptible and restartable; * disabled by default<br>
(next): next release; (soon): in a near-future release



It is straightforward to implement new backends that leverage other
ways to harness available compute resources. As soon as a new backend
has been validated to be compliant with the Future API specifications,
which can be done by the **[future.tests]** package, then it can be
used anywhere future-based code is used.
