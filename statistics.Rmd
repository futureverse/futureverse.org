Since the first CRAN release of **future** in June 2015, its uptake among end-users and package developers have grown steadily.
During March 2021, **future** was among the top-1.0% most downloaded package on CRAN (Figure 1) and there are 170 packages on CRAN and Bioconductor that directly depend on it (Figure 2).  For map-reduce parallelization packages **future.apply** (top-2.1% most downloaded) and and **furrr** (top 1.4%), the corresponding number of packages are 75 and 44, respectively.

As a reference, the popular **foreach**, release in 2009, was among the top-0.9% most downloaded packages during the same period and it has almost 800 reverse package dependencies on CRAN and Bioconductor.  The number of users that download **future** has grown rapidly whereas the the same number has slowly decreased for the **foreach** package (Figure 1).  Similarly, the number of reverse package dependencies on **future** appear to grow faster than for **foreach** (Figure 2).

Importantly, the comparison toward **foreach** is only done as a reference for the current demand for parallelization frameworks in R and to show the rapid uptake of the future framework since its release.  It is not a competion because **foreach** can per design be used in companion with the future framework via **doFuture**.  The choice between **foreach** with **doFuture**, **future.apply**, and **furrr** is a matter of preference of coding style - they all rely on futures for parallelization.
